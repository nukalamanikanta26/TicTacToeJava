PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a simple Java-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Replit. 
It allows two players to take turns placing X and O marks on a 3×3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.


KEY CONCEPTS IN TICTACTOE

 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Use of classes like TicTacToe encapsulates game logic and board data.
- Methods are organized within the class to handle initialization, moves, display, and game rules.
2. Arrays
- A 2D array (char[][]) represents the game board—ideal for mapping a grid structure.
3. Control Flow
- Loops: Used for iterating over the game board, and managing turn-based gameplay.
- Conditionals: Handle input validation, win checks, and turn switching.
4. Input Handling
- Scanner reads user input from the console.
- Robust input validation ensures proper game behavior (e.g. no overwriting moves).
5. Modularity
- Functions like haveWon(), gameOver(), printBoard() break the program into manageable parts.
- Improves readability and maintainability.
